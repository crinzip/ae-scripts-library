# After Effects Scripts Library
A collection of AE scripts I made for myself, using whatever LLM was trending at the time

## List of Scripts
#### 1. Tiny Script Launcher: [.jsx File](https://github.com/crinzip/ae-scripts-library/blob/main/Scripts/Tiny%20Script%20Launcher.jsx)
Pocket size script launcher that helps you navigate your scripts folder faster + there's a neat search feature too

#### 2. Crop Comp to Layer(s): [.jsx File](https://github.com/crinzip/ae-scripts-library/blob/main/Scripts/Crop%20Comp%20To%20Layer.jsx)
Crop your composition to the bounding box of one or multiple layers
